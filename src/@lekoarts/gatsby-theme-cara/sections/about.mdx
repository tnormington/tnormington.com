## About Me

> I have been building websites professionally for 10 years. I enjoy both design and development, with a specialization in the front-end.

I grew up in southern New Hampshire and I don't think I could ever leave New England. I got to see my parents start a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.windhamjunction.com/">restaurant</a> from scratch and see it transform from a storage-filled garage into the successful landmark that it is today. I have a real appreciation for people out there running their own business, and I understand how much work it can be.

My goal is to build whatever it is you need to promote or empower the online presence of your business. Whether that is a simple website, online store, brand design, or app development, I can provide web solutions for any situation.
